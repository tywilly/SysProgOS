This directory contains the source code for all user-level processes,
split out by main function.

Naming convention:

    idle()      classic 'idle' process; can be used if there is a
                need to have an always-runnable process to dispatch
                (vs., for instance, having dispatch() pause when there
                is nothing to dispatch).

    init()      classic 'init' process; starts the other user-level
                processes based on the SPAWN_* macros in users.h

    mainN()     generic main function, used by several user processes
                with different command-line args

    userX()     "one-task" main function; may be started by multiple
                user processes

All of these accept at least one command-line argument.  All are invoked
with command lines of this form:

    name  x  n  s

where the first character of 'x' is what the process periodically prints
to the serial output, 'n' is an iteration count, and 's' is a sleep time
(in seconds).  All have default values for these, and all arguments are
optional (but are positional).

In order to compile and link these into separate executables (e.g., for
placement into separate pages in memory), add a #include of "users.h" and
of "common.h" to each source file.  Each should be linked with the two
user library objects (ulibc.o and ulibs.o) from the distribution.
