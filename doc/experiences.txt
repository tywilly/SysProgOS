Abstract
----------------------------------------
This document chronicles the journey taken by the team throughout the semester. 


In The Beginning...
----------------------------------------
Once baseline development was coming to a close, we started considering our
options for potential augmentations for it. A giant group amassed in the
southeast corner of the DSL, each person excited about bolting certain 
functionality into the baseline. We ultimately decided to split into two
teams based on which group of features would best complement each other.
Our group decided to tackle making an audio player of some kind, with drivers
for various sound hardware, CD-ROM, and USB storage for storing music files.
Our original target devices were Intel AC97, Intel HD Audio.

The other group decided to tackle networking, filesystems, and another USB 
implementation. Realizing the potential of a really cool final product, we
decided that we would work closely with each other, and try to merge all eight
(8!) projects into one if there was time. The end result could have been
something like a low-budget Spotify with samples streaming and playing on 
different machines.


The Plot Thickens...
----------------------------------------
Right around spring break, we drew the "stay home; global pandemic" card (Do
not pass Go, Do not collect $200). As a result, we lost a week of time to work
on finishing the baseline system, and our group members started considering
simpler enhancements due to the added challenge of working from home, using
emulators instead of actual hardware, etc.
