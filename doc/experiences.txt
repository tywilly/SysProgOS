Abstract
----------------------------------------
This document chronicles the journey taken by the team throughout the semester.


In The Beginning...
----------------------------------------
Once baseline development was coming to a close, we started considering our
options for potential augmentations for it. A giant group amassed in the
southeast corner of the DSL, each person excited about bolting certain
functionality into the baseline. We ultimately decided to split into two
teams based on which group of features would best complement each other.
Our group decided to tackle making an audio player of some kind, with drivers
for various sound hardware, CD-ROM, and USB storage for storing music files.
Our original target devices were Intel AC97, Intel HD Audio.

The other group decided to tackle networking, file systems, and another USB
implementation. Realizing the potential of a really cool final product, we
decided that we would work closely with each other, and try to merge all eight
(8!) projects into one if there was time. The end result could have been
something like a low-budget Spotify with samples streaming and playing on
different machines.

We set up a shared slack workspace for the two teams to stay in close contact,
as well as a shared GitHub repository. At the time of writing this document,
it seems that no efforts will be made to merge all of the enhancements together
into one ubersystem given the circumstances. However, someone could pick that
up as a personal project if they desire.


The Plot Thickens...
----------------------------------------
Right around spring break, we drew the "stay home; global pandemic" card (Do
not pass Go, Do not collect $200). As a result, we lost a week of time to work
on finishing the baseline system, and our group members started considering
simpler enhancements due to the added challenge of working from home, using
emulators instead of actual hardware, etc.

Our team also had to cope with a 6-hour time difference. It turned out to be
easier than I thought it would be, since there's a pretty wide swath of time
that we're all awake. After setting up our home workstations and QEMU
environments, we began working individually on our drivers.


AC97 Driver Development
----------------------------------------
Working from home took some adjustment for me. I am the type of person who
thrives in structured environments. When literally all of the structure I was
accustomed to crumbled away, it took me a few weeks to settle into new routines
before I was able to get back to full productivity.

My prior experience with embedded development helped me keep realistic
expectations about my daily progress throughout, and mainly that it will seem
hopeless until suddenly it will start working. My first major milestone was
to detect whether or not there even was an AC97 Audio Controller present in
the system. This didn't take too long once we had a working PCI support library
because all I needed to do was look for vendor 0x8086 (they are obsessed with
that number...) device ID 0x2415. To my knowledge, this is the only AC97 audio
controller that QEMU is capable of emulating. I verified that this worked by
either passing the -soundhw ac97 option or not.

Once that was working, the goal was to get it to fire an interrupt at me. By
this point I discovered that the actual Intel AC97 Specification was not very
helpful in determining the initialization process. I looked at some existing
implementations of AC97 audio drivers to better understand what needs to be
done to bring the device up. I also discovered two other specs that included
imperative information such as theory of operation, and even a programmer's
reference manual. I worked for a few days setting register contents and reading
them back to see if they behaved the way I expected them to. Most of the time
I got zeroes or things other than the defaults from the specification.

A few days in, I discovered that my base addresses were wrong, so I wasn't
actually writing to the registers I thought I was. After I got that sorted
out, I started seeing default register values that made sense, and
I got my echoed values back as expected.

At long last, I got the interrupt to fire one time only. This was the first
real indication that the controller liked any of the bits I was tickling. After
I added the PIC_EOI thing, it started vomiting interrupts so fast that it was
the only thing on the console output. It still hadn't made a peep, but I hadn't
given it anything to do yet.

I spent the next couple days learning about how the DMA controller operates,
and that it's pretty picky about things like alignment. It expects a buffer
descriptor list, which is an array of 2 longwords that hold various information
about each buffer. There are 32 in total. They hold things like a pointer to the
next buffer, the number of samples in the buffer, whether or not to interrupt on
completion, etc. I allocated a static array of those, because they're not super
big, and the DMA controller gets angry if they suddenly disappear.

As for the buffers themselves, they can be any length up to 4096 16-bit samples.
On initialization, I decided to allocate 32 4KB pages with no intention of ever
giving them back. Each buffer holds 256 PCM audio samples, and across all 32 of
them, it still only holds a very small duration of audio--much less than a tenth
of a second at the default playback speed of 48 kHz. Even playing a clip that
is a few seconds long will result in each buffer's data being replaced hundreds
or even thousands of times. I decided deallocating and re-allocating in that
situation doesn't make much sense. The system probably won't miss 32 pages
dedicated to audio data anyways.

Once that was set up, I purposely didn't clear any of the buffers to see what
the random data inside them might sound like. Unfortunately, it was all clear
or very nearly clear because I couldn't even make out crackles and pops. I went
off in search of something to play.

As a quick break, I dredged up an old Thinkpad I had in my closet. I spent an
hour wallowing up to my armpits in nostalgia for Windows XP. After listening
to each sound several times, I realized that XP was the pinnacle of Microsoft
acoustic design. So, I scraped the wav files for use (abuse?) in the baseline.

For testing purposes, and until my group-mates got their storage drivers up and
running, I needed to compile in my audio data somehow. I found the easiest way
was to use the linker to turn them into binary object files. It even exported
variables I could use from the code to get to the start and end of the binary
blob. The only issue I ran into is that this severely limits the length of the
audio files I can include before the program becomes too large to start at
0x10000. When I tried up-sampling the orchestral startup sound to the AC97
default sample rate of 48 kHz from its original 22.5, but it made the file too
large to link in. To save space, I ended up figuring how to change the AC97
DAC rate, and down-sampled it to 8 kHz. It sounds more muffled, but it's still
recognizable. It was honestly more nostalgic that way, since for most of my
childhood, the computer speakers weren't very good anyway.

I used __memcpy to load the buffer initially with the beginning of the startup
sound. When it played (at the wrong sample rate) I nearly fell out of my chair.
I think I was so excited that it worked that I took the rest of the day off.
I came back refreshed and wrote the ISR to cycle the data through the buffer
so the whole sound played. Once all of that was working, I exposed some of the
driver's functionality to userland, and wrote a user application that played the
sound after init starts.

I made no attempts at mixing or implementing streams. If two processes try to
write to the controller, I'm not sure what will happen, but I am very confident
that it will make very ugly noises. Implementing streams and mixing would
require significant implementation effort. If we hadn't lost a week to our
extended spring break, I could have tackled it. A userland player that
takes audio data from USB or CD sources was in the works, but it depends on
everyone else's drivers working. I took all of the Windows XP sounds, and I feel
that they should all (or as many as possible) be incorporated into the system
when certain events occur rather than using console output. I also grabbed a
clip of Prof. Carithers saying "such is life" from a zoom meeting that plays
marvelously.


Ensoniq SoundBlaster Driver Development
----------------------------------------
(Zach Jones)

The transition to working from home wasn't too bad for me, the problem was my
setup. Mac's don't compile 32-bit programs anymore, so I had to install a
virtual machine. I went with Ubuntu since that seemed the most user-friendly
for someone that's not used to Linux stuff. I tried to build qemu from source
from the one suggested, but I couldn't get that to work so I used the
pre-packaged latest version. This worked out fine.

I have almost no embedded systems development experience, other than
some knowledge of x86 assembly (I learned the 64-bit calling convention though).
I'm glad that I was able to work with C to get almost all the code for this
done.

On my mac, turns out it doesn't have the Intel HDA, but rather something
proprietary. On the lab machines, there was the Intel HDA. Rather than abandon
sound, I went with a different approach, what can I run with the VMWare fusion?
VMWare as it turns out only exports an Ensoniq / Creative Labs ES1373, which
is the predecessor to the AC97. There is the slightly older Ensoniq
SoundBlaster ES1370, which was a bit simpler and "documented". I put
documented in quotes, because while it goes through some of the main registers,
it never specifies quite a bit of the important stuff.
It also doesn't specify that the one channel doesn't work unless you do
some other closed-source set of instructions.

Like the other sound system, my first milestone was to get it detected
on the PCI bus. Turns out, even if you have the hardware emulated on VMWare,
qemu doesn't emulate it unless you specify -soundhw es1370. I did the same
thing with looking for vendor (0x1274) and device ID (0x5000).

My goal was to make my version not have a dependency on getting USB or
some other way to input data to play working first.
My first steps was instead of trying to feed it pre-recorded sound, I
thought "I'll just give it a 440 hz sound wave, that should sound like
The 4th A on a piano." Turns out, since we don't have the C standard library
at our disposal, I had to write my own implementation of the sine function.
This made it so that I could just send sample down to the sound card as needed,
so I initially tested it out with loop when done = true, don't interrupt.
This made no sound, because I didn't turn the audio volume on, or PCI mastering,
but there was no indication in the small documentation I could find.
I had to reverse-engineer some code from Linux to get this it working.

Now, the sound would play for about 1 second, but it would have about 1/10th
of it be silent, on loop. I thought this might have to do with not implementing
the interrupts, so I went to that next.
I got the interrupt working pretty easily after that, and since this initial
point took so long, I had the help of Cody for the PCI usage.

The soundblaster only uses one buffer, and when it spits out the interrupt,
you (the OS) have less than 50 ms or something like that to acknowledge and
replace the buffer address and played count or it will hop to the beginning
of the sound sample. Since I could only get ok quality sound with the highest
sample rate of 48 khz, I allocated the biggest buffer possible of 64 pages.
It only supports up to 2^^16th samples since it must fit in a 16-bit register,
which runs out in 0.34 seconds.

Also with the user program, I thought it would be cool to play a simple song.
I was going to do the song "Hot Cross Buns" that I remember having to play in
elementary school, but after talking to the group, "Sandstorm" by Darude, which
is just 4 different notes would definitely sound cooler. Plus it repeats the
3-6 measures basically the whole song, which is nice for the meme-y effect.

The part of getting this setup wasn't too bad, but since this needs to be
calculating all this data, it can't keep up with the sound that is playing,
so it sounded really crazy. In order to do this, I create 5 buffers in the
user program, and filled them up at startup (takes a couple seconds).
(I allocated these from the kernel module since there's no malloc).
This worked much better in terms of sound quality, but required a lot more
memory (another 320 pages) to get about .3 seconds of each frequency and
silence to separate out the notes.

I also made no attempt of mixing sounds, this would be a huge task without
sound card hardware support, and would likely take longer to mix the sound
using CPU time than the sample rate. 


USB Storage Driver Development
----------------------------------------
I started this project by reading USB documentation. And there’s a lot 
out there. Since I didn’t know what I was doing, I picked the wrong one. 
It was too low level specifications that would’ve helped someone designing
a controller, not a driver. After doing so, which in itself was not an easy
and fun process I still wondered: what exactly do I write in my usb.c file?!
Thanks to the professor’s help, I started working on the PCI module.

During the PCI phase of the project, I haven’t had too many issues as the
documentation I followed (from OSDev) was very complete and well explained.
The only thing that challenged me was the writing process, which wasn’t
explained in OSDev’s article and took some more digging around to find
documentation for.

It seems like an issue disappeared from my presentation, so in exclusivity:
another mistake I made. When I started working on the EHCI driver, the first
thing I needed to do was getting the base address from the PCI and then
getting the operational base address, which required to read data from the
EHCI controller base address. To read from the EHCI registers, I invented
a new way to do direct I/O with 32 bit addresses instead of ports, which
obviously did not work. Looking back, I think I just imitated what I did for
the PCI module without understanding what I did and why. Also the
documentation didn’t ever state precisely how to make use of addresses, which
may be obvious to some, but, to reiterate, I didn't know what I was doing
(and maybe still don't). Tyler Wilcox helped me figure out what was wrong
with my code. EHCI addresses make use of Memory-Mapped I/O, so you're
supposed to use them as pointers. 

Then it was time to start working on the EHCI driver and once again, I had
to start fresh on documentation. Tyler Wilcox handed me a link to a
simplified description of EHCI data structures and control transfers, which
helped me a lot in taking a step back to understand globally how the EHCI
controller worked. I could then refer to the EHCI documentation more easily.

Trying to get my first control request to work, I got into another problem.
The first QTD in the sequence blew up to my face whatever tweaking I did
to the code. Once again after some time struggling, I contacted Tyler who
told me I forgot resetting the port to which the flash drive was connected.
I did that and the second QTD in the sequence blew up.

I spent another period struggling to find what was causing the issue. The only
lead I had was the IN QTD's Halt bit being set to 1, which, following the
documentation, means that "a serious error has occurred at the device/endpoint
addressed by this qTD". This could happen for a number of reasons, none of
which the other conditions were met (the other corresponding error bits were
clear).

After a lot of time struggling and getting nowhere. I switched to doing
documentation work. On Tuesday April 28, I found the bug: the byte ordering of
the request buffer was wrong. I fixed the issue and started working on
reorganizing the USB module, which was at a state where I was just trying out
to send a first request (everything was done in the init sequence with no
function call). I implemented as many different control requests as I could.

My PCI module was then used by other team members (instead of using Tyler's)
which turned ou to cause issues. The bug, which came from the PCI writing
functions, was found and fixed relatively easily this time. It was caused by a
'&' which should've been an '|' and (I know) and bas use or __outl (I swapped
port and value).

All these issues add up to a lot of time wasted. The USB module cannot be
used to perform I/O transfers to the flash drive, so no system calls were
added to the OS. Also that means it cannot be used to store and load audio
media, so it doesn’t have an impact on the overall audio project. However,
for proof of work, two “dump all” functions were added to the console (one
for the PCI module and one for the USB module). They both display connected
device information. And the PCI module is used by other members’ modules.

Bring on the Merge Conflicts

Merging all of the components into the system was not very difficult. The
hardest merge was when we started using Yann's PCI module.
